At Present, the application of the IoT develops rapidly, but due to the special requirements of some applications, the existing technology can not meet them very good. Much research work is doing to build IoT. WiFi-based Wireless Sensor Network(WSN) has the features of high bandwidth and rate, non-line-transmission ability, large-scale data collection and high cost-effective, and it has the capability of video monitoring, which can not be realized with ZigBee. The research on WiFi-based WSN and its application has high practical significance to the development of the Internet of Things and Smart Grid. Based on the current research work of applications in the Internet of Things and the characteristics of WiFi-based WSN, this paper discusses the application of WiFi-based WSN in Internet of Things, which includes Smart Grid, Smart Agriculture and Intelligent environment protection.},

The paper mainly aims to categorize the routing problems and examines the routing-related optimization problems. For achieving the motive, 50 papers from the standard journals are collected and primarily reviewed in a chronological way. Later, various features that are related to energy, security, speed and reliability problems of routing are discussed. Subsequently, the literature is analyzed based on the simulation environment and experimental setup, awareness over the Quality of Service (QoS) and the deployment against various applications. In addition, the optimization of the routing algorithms and the meta-heuristic study of routing optimization are explored. Routing is a vast area with numerous unsolved issues and hence, various research gaps along with future directions are also presented.},

Contemporary enhancements in the field of wireless communications, memory, processor and radio technology have enabled the growth of low-cost sensor networks and sensor nodes which is proficient in sensing, communication and calculation. These sensor networks have tremendous applications in the various fields of life (Medical, military, industry, surveillance systems, etc.). Because of this large number of applications, there are copious routing protocols and techniques under which these sensor networks are accomplished. This survey presents the current state of the art of WSN's, a collective knowledge of those routing protocols (S-MAC, MAC, IEEE 802.11, LEACH, and SPIN) and energy efficient techniques (clustering technique, directed diffusion technique) which are being implemented for their competent functioning. Further, those routing protocols will be discussed briefly and their different aspects and characteristics will be compared. Finally, a better idea among all these routing protocols and energy efficient techniques for WSN's will be presented.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.Recent advances in environmental sources harvesting technologies is a promising solution to provide sustainable energy sources for wireless sensor networks (WSN). Renewable energy sources such as solar, thermal and electromagnetic waves constitute viable alternatives to maximize the network lifetime. Therefore, networking software awareness and adaptability to energy availability conditions should translate into innovative supporting features for data gathering, aggregation, routing and dissemination. Thus, it is paramount to develop robust energy harvesting-aware networking platforms that support the above services and guarantee low energy consumption and data integrity in a noisy, constrained environment. In this paper, we present an opportunistic routing and data dissemination protocol for energy harvesting wireless sensor network (EH-WSN) based on cross-layer constructs that allows across the layers synchronization and coordination between the routing protocol and the application layer services. The OMNET++ based extensive simulation of this protocol showed promising results in terms of meeting application requirements of handling urgent traffic and delay tolerant traffic seamlessly and ensuring energy usage efficiency.},

Sensor network nodes are limited with respect to energy supply, restricted computational capacity and communication bandwidth. Most of the attention, however, has been given to the routing protocols since they might differ depending on the application and network architecture. To prolong the lifetime of the sensor nodes, designing efficient routing protocols is critical. Even though sensor networks are primarily designed for monitoring and reporting events, since they are application dependent, a single routing protocol cannot be efficient for sensor networks across all applications. In this paper, we analyze the design issues of sensor networks and present a classification and comparison of routing protocols. This comparison reveals the important features that need to be taken into consideration while designing and evaluating new routing protocols for sensor networks.},

@article{Chanak2016,
abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks are prone to link/node failures due to various environmental hazards such as interference and internal faults in deployed sensor nodes. Such failures can result in a disconnection in part of the network and the sensed data being unable to obtain a route to the sink(s), i.e. a network failure. Network failures potentially degrade the Quality of Service (QoS) of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). It is very difficult to monitor network failures using a manual operator in a harsh or hostile environment. In such environments, communication links can easy fail because of node unequal energy depletion and hardware failure or invasion. Thus it is desirable that deployed sensor nodes are capable of overcoming network failures. In this paper, we consider the problem of tolerating network failures seen by deployed sensor nodes in a WSN. We first propose a novel clustering algorithm for WSNs, termed Distributed Energy Efficient Heterogeneous Clustering (DEEHC) that selects cluster heads according to the residual energy of deployed sensor nodes with the aid of a secondary timer. During the clustering phase, each sensor node finds k-vertex disjoint paths to cluster heads depending on the energy level of its neighbor sensor nodes. We then present a k-Vertex Disjoint Path Routing (kVDPR) algorithm where each cluster head finds k-vertex disjoint paths to the base station and relays their aggregate data to the base station. Furthermore, we also propose a novel Route Maintenance Mechanism (RMM) that can repair k-vertex disjoint paths throughout the monitoring session. The resulting WSNs become tolerant to k-1 failures in the worst case. The proposed scheme has been extensively tested using various network scenarios and compared to the existing state of the art approaches to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {The terminology Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a future where every day physical objects are connected by the Internet in one form or the other, but outside the traditional desktop realm. The successful emergence of the IoT vision, however, will require computing to extend past traditional scenarios involving portables and smart-phones to the connection of everyday physical objects and the integration of intelligence with the environment. Subsequently, this will lead to the development of new computing features and challenges. The main purpose of this paper, therefore, is to investigate the features, challenges, and weaknesses that will come about, as the IoT becomes reality with the connection of more and more physical objects. Specifically, the study seeks to assess emergent challenges due to denial of service attacks, eavesdropping, node capture in the IoT infrastructure, and physical security of the sensors. We conducted a literature review about IoT, their features, challenges, and vulnerabilities. The methodology paradigm used was qualitative in nature with an exploratory research design, while data was collected using the desk research method. We found that, in the distributed form of architecture in IoT, attackers could hijack unsecured network devices converting them into bots to attack third parties. Moreover, attackers could target communication channels and extract data from the information flow. Finally, the perceptual layer in distributed IoT architecture is also found to be vulnerable to node capture attacks, including physical capture, brute force attack, DDoS attacks, and node privacy leaks.},

The sensor nodes contain a battery constraint which limit the network lifetime. Due to energy constraints, the deployment of WSNs will required advance techniques to maintain the network lifetime. A clustering based routing algorithm called Low- Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) was proposed as a solution for low power consumption. This document is a study about LEACH algorithm where the implementation was done using OMNeT++ network simulator to study the performance of this algorithm in term of network lifetime. OMNeT++ was selected as a simulator because it provides some important features for this project like very good scalability unlike other simulators do. During this study, LEACH algorithm shows some drawbacks that need an improvements to overcome it as to improve the performance. Then, the modified LEACH algorithm was proposed where the improvement was done in cluster head selection based on LEACH. In cluster head selection, modified LEACH taking into account the residual energy of each node for calculation of the threshold value for next round. Meanwhile in LEACH, the cluster head selection was based on distributed algorithm. Both of these protocols was implemented in network simulator to compare the performance. This study shows that there were a better performance achieved by modified LEACH depends on the results obtained.},

They are now ubiquitous and used in a plurality of application domains. WSNs are still domain specific and usually deployed to support a specific application. However, as WSNs' nodes are becoming more and more powerful, it is getting more and more pertinent to research how multiple applications could share a very same WSN infrastructure. Virtualization is a technology that can potentially enable this sharing. This paper is a survey on WSN virtualization. It provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art and an in-depth discussion of the research issues. We introduce the basics of WSN virtualization and motivate its pertinence with carefully selected scenarios. Existing works are presented in detail and critically evaluated using a set of requirements derived from the scenarios. The pertinent research projects are also reviewed. Several research issues are also discussed with hints on how they could be tackled.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks have the potential to become significant subsystems of engineering applications. Before relegating important and safety-critical tasks to such subsystems, it is necessary to understand the dynamic behavior of these subsystems in simulation environments. There is an urgent need to develop simulation platforms that are useful to explore both the networking issues and the distributed computing aspects of wireless sensor networks. Current efforts to simulating wireless sensor networks largely focus on the networking issues. These approaches use well-known network simulation tools that are difficult to extend to explore distributed computing issues. Discrete-event simulation is a trusted platform for modeling and simulating a variety of systems. We report results obtained from a new simulator for wireless sensor networks networks that is based on the discrete event simulation framework called OMNeT++. Work is underway to develop a simulation platform that allows developers and researchers to investigate topological, phenomenological, networking, robustness and scaling issues related to wireless sensor networks. As a first step, we have developed simulations for the 802.11 MAC and the well-known sensor network protocol called Directed Diffusion. We demonstrate the performance of our simulator by comparing its performance to that of the well-known simulator ns2. Our results indicate that our simulator executes at least an order of magnitude faster than NS-2 and makes more efficient use of the available memory. The ease of modifying the sensor network and scalability, which is defined as the number of nodes that can be simulated, are two distinguishing features of our simulator.

abstract = {The literature is very broad considering routing protocols in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, security of these routing protocols has fallen beyond the scope so far. Routing is a fundamental functionality in wireless networks, thus hostile interventions aiming to disrupt and degrade the routing service have a serious impact on the overall operation of the entire network. In order to analyze the security of routing protocols in a precise and rigorous way, we propose a formal framework encompassing the definition of an adversary model as well as the "general" definition of secure routing in sensor networks. Both definitions take into account the feasible goals and capabilities of an adversary in sensor environments and the variety of sensor routing protocols. In spirit, our formal model is based on the simulation paradigm that is a successfully used technique to prove the security of various cryptographic protocols. However, we also highlight some differences between our model and other models that have been proposed for wired or wireless networks. Finally, we illustrate the practical usage of our model by presenting the formal description of a simple attack against an authenticated routing protocol, which is based on the well-known TinyOS routing.},

abstract = {The transport protocols for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) play vital role in achieving the high performance together with longevity of the network. The researchers are continuously contributing in developing new transport layer protocols based on different principles and architectures enabling different combinations of technical features. The uniqueness of each new protocol more or less lies in these functional features, which can be commonly classified based on their proficiencies in fulfilling congestion control, reliability support, and prioritization. The performance of these protocols has been evaluated using dissimilar set of experimental/simulation parameters, thus there is no well defined benchmark for experimental/simulation settings. The researchers working in this area have to compare the performance of the new protocol with the existing protocols to prove that new protocol is better. However, one of the major challenges faced by the researchers is investigating the performance of all the existing protocols, which have been tested in different simulation environments. This leads the significance of having a well-defined benchmark for the experimental/simulation settings. If the future researchers simulate their protocols according to a standard set of simulation/experimental settings, the performance of those protocols can be directly compared with each other just using the published simulation results. This article offers a twofold contribution to support researchers working in the area of WSN transport protocol design. First, we extensively review the technical features of existing transport protocols and suggest a generic framework for a WSN transport protocol, which offers a strong groundwork for the new researchers to identify the open research issues. Second we analyse the experimental settings, focused application areas and the addressed performance criteria of existing protocols; thus suggest a benchmark of experimental/simulation settings for evaluating prospective transport protocols.?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for Internet of Things (IoT) can be deployed in a wide range of industries such as agriculture and military. However, designing a secure and reliable authentication scheme for WSNs that can be deployed in IoT remains a research and operational challenge. For example, recently in 2016, Amin and Biswas showed that the Turcanovi{\'{c}} et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to smart card loss attack, user impersonation attack, etc. They then proposed a new authentication scheme for WSNs with multi-gateway. In this paper, we revisit the scheme of Amin and Biswas and reveal previously unknown vulnerabilities in the scheme (i.e. sensor capture attack, user forgery attack, gateway forgery attack, sensor forgery attack and off-line guessing attack). In addition, we demonstrate that the user in the scheme can be tracked due to the use of a constant pseudo-identity and previously established session keys can be calculated by the attacker. Rather than attempting to fix a broken scheme, we present a novel authentication scheme for multi-gateway based WSNs. We then demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme using Proverif, as well as evaluating the good performance of the scheme using NS-2 simulation.},

In the lieu of this, design of routing protocols should take into consideration various design issues and routing challenges. Considering the importance of fact, various routing protocols have been presented in the literature for WSN. Four main categories of routing protocols, namely location based, data centric, hierarchical and multipath based protocols are covered in this paper. A comprehensive survey of different routing protocols presented in the literature for WSNs is presented in this paper. Later on, we discuss various design challenges of WSN, advantages, disadvantages and performance obstacles related to each routing protocol.

WSNs gather information from the environment by measuring mechanical, thermal, biological, chemical, optical or magnetic incidents and transmit the collected information from sensor nodes to a sink node. However there are many sensors nodes which can be commercially sold in the markets, these nodes cost high prices and low cost and easy to build up sensor nodes are needed in low budget applications. The aim of this study is to create a low cost wireless sensor network for environment monitoring by using Arduino Platform. In accordance to this aim, Arduino Uno R3 modules are used as wireless sensor network motes. Moreover, to collect data from nodes and communicate between our sensor nodes, a low cost radio transceiver called NRF24L01+ is used for the wireless communication. In to monitor environment, four kinds of sensors (temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide and methane) suitable for Arduino platform selected.

abstract = {ZigBee is the emerging industrial standard for ad hoc networks based on IEEE 802.15.4. Due to characteristics such as low data rate, low price, and low power consumption, ZigBee is expected to be used in wireless sensor networks for remote monitoring, home control, and industrial automation. Since one of the most important goals is to reduce the installation and running cost, ZigBee stack is embedded in small and cheap micro-controller units. Since tree routing does not require any routing tables to send the packet to the destination, it can be used in ZigBee end devices that have limited resources. However, tree routing has the problem that the packets follow the tree topology to the destination even if the destination is located nearby. We propose the shortcut tree routing protocol to reduce the routing cost of ZigBee tree routing by using the neighbor table that is originally defined in the ZigBee standard. While following the ZigBee tree routing algorithm, we suggest forwarding the packet to the neighbor node if it can reduce the routing cost to the destination. Simulation results show that the shortcut tree routing algorithm saves more than 30 percent of the hop count compared with ZigBee tree routing.},

The concept of weighted probability is used to assign the CH (Cluster Head) of the network cluster. The proposed algorithm is simulated, tested and compared with previously established routing protocols and has shown enhanced results and prolonged network lifespan.

The design of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors such as the environment, the application's design objectives, cost, hardware, and system constraints. The goal of our survey is to present a comprehensive review of the recent literature since the publication of [I.F. Akyildiz, W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E.

Following a top-down approach, we give an overview of several new applications and then review the literature on various aspects of WSNs.

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have seen rapid research and industrial development in recent years. Both the costs and size of individual nodes have been constantly decreasing, opening new opportunities for a wide range of applications. Nevertheless, designing software to achieve energy-efficient, robust and flexible data dissemination remains an open problem with many competing solutions. In parallel, researchers have effectively exploited machine learning techniques to achieve ef-ficient solutions in environments with distribution and rapidly fluctuating properties, analo-gous to WSN domains. Applying machine learning techniques to WSNs inherently has the potential to improve the robustness and flexibility of communications and data processing, while simultaneously optimizing energy expenditure. This chapter concentrates on applications of machine learning at all layers in the WSN net-work stack. First, it provides a brief background and summary of three of the most com-monly used machine learning techniques: reinforcement learning, neural networks and deci-sion trees. Then, it uses example research from the literature to describe current efforts at each level of the stack, and outlines future opportunities. 1. Wireless Sensor Networks Extensive research effort has been invested in recent years to optimize communications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Researchers and application developers typically use a communication stack model such as that depicted in Figure 1 to structure the communications of WSNs and to better manage its challenges. In particular, the following properties of WSNs should be considered while designing innovative and efficient solutions (Akyildiz et al., 2002; R{\"{o}}mer {\&} Mattern, 2004). • Wireless ad-hoc nature. No fixed communication infrastructure exists. The shared wire-less medium places restrictions on the communication between nodes and poses new problems such as asymmetric links. However, it offers the broadcast advantage: a trans-mitted packet, even if sent in unicast to another node, can be overhead and thus re-ceived by all neighbors of the transmitter.},

abstract = {This paper is part of a study of intelligent architectures for distributed control and communications systems. The study focuses on optimizing control systems by evaluating the performance of middleware through quality of service (QoS) parameters and the optimization of control using Quality of Control (QoC) parameters. The main aim of this work is to study, design, develop, and evaluate a distributed control architecture based on the Data-Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems (DDS) communication standard as proposed by the Object Management Group (OMG). As a result of the study, an architecture called Frame-Sensor-Adapter to Control (FSACtrl) has been developed. FSACtrl provides a model to implement an intelligent distributed Event-Based Control (EBC) system with support to measure QoS and QoC parameters. The novelty consists of using, simultaneously, the measured QoS and QoC parameters to make decisions about the control action with a new method called Event Based Quality Integral Cycle. To validate the architecture, the first five Braitenberg vehicles have been implemented using the FSACtrl architecture. The experimental outcomes, demonstrate the convenience of using jointly QoS and QoC parameters in distributed control systems.},

@article{Jiang2008,
abstract = {In wireless ad-hoc sensor networks, an important issue often faced in geographic greedy forwarding routing is the "local minimum phenomenon" which is caused by deployment holes and blocks the forwarding process. In this paper, we provide a new information model for the geographic greedy forwarding routing that only forwards the packet within the so-called request zone. Under this new information model, the hole and its affected area are identified easily and quickly in an unsafe area with a labeling process. The greedy forwarding will be blocked if and only if a node inside the unsafe area is used. Due to the shape of the request zone, an unsafe area can be estimated as a rectangular region in the local view of unsafe nodes. With such estimate information, the new routing method proposed in this paper will avoid blocking by holes and achieve better performance in routing time while the cost of information construction is greatly reduced compared with the best results known to date.},

abstract = {The trend towards adoption of Wireless Sensor Networks is increasing in recent years because of its diverse use in various fields. Wireless Sensor Network is formed via interconnection of large number of sensor nodes. Each and every sensor node deployed in network monitors various parameters like Temperature; Humidity; Ambient Light; Gas etc. and send the data to the master node. Despite of several applications and diverse uses; sensor networks face various shortcomings like energy; localization; security; self-organization; fault tolerance and many more. So; the area of Wireless Sensor Network is under rigorous research and development by various researchers across the globe to develop new algorithms; protocols and techniques to make WSN network more efficient and reliable. Before live implementation; testing of the developed technique requires rigorous testing. But it is not always possible to have live sensor network environment. So; in that case; Simulation is the only way to test the research before moving towards live implementation. Large numbers of simulation tools are available for WSN network till date; out of which some are dedicated towards wireless sensor networks and some for both wireless and wired networks. The main objective behind this research paper is to do a comprehensive review of various simulation tools of Wireless Sensor Networks to enable researcher to select the most competent tool for simulating wireless sensor networks and testing the research proposed. A comprehensive review of 31 WSN simulators is being presented along with their respective features comparison to assist researchers in advanced WSN based research.},

abstract = {Network simulators are necessary for testing algorithms of large scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs), but lack the accuracy of real-world deployments. Deploying real WSN testbed provides a more realistic test environment, and allows users to get more accurate test results. However, deploying real testbed is highly constrained by the available budget when the test needs a large scale WSN environment. By leveraging the advantages of both network simulator and real testbed, an approach that integrates simulation environment and testbed can effectively solve both scalability and accuracy issues. Hence, the simulation of virtual WSN, the visualization of real testbed, and the interaction between simulated WSN and testbed emerge as three key challenges. In this paper, we present an integrated framework called NetTopo for providing both simulation and visualization functions to assist the investigation of algorithms in WSNs. NetTopo provides a common virtual WSN for the purpose of interaction between sensor devices and simulated virtual nodes. Two case studies are described to prove the effectiveness of NetTopo.},

abstract = {A wireless network consisting of hundreds or thousands of cheap microsensor nodes allow users accurately monitor the characteristics of the remote environment or detect an event. As the sensor nodes have limited energy resources, so the routing protocol designed for the wireless sensor networks should be energy efficient and provide low latency. For this reason, we propose advanced low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (ALEACH), a clustering-based protocol architecture where nodes make autonomous decision without any central intervention. ALEACH proposes a new cluster head selection algorithms that enables selecting best suited node for cluster head, algorithms for adaptive clusters and rotating cluster head positions to evenly distribute the energy load among all the nodes. Simulation results show that ALEACH can improve system life time and energy efficiency in terms of different simulation performance metrics. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a family of adaptive protocols, called SPIN (Sensor Protocols for Information via Negotiation), that efficiently disseminate information among sensors in an energy-constrained wireless sensor network. Nodes running a SPIN communication protocol name their data using high-level data descriptors, called meta-data. They use meta-data negotiations to eliminate the transmission of redundant data throughout the network. In addition, SPIN nodes can base their communication decisions both upon application-specific knowledge of the data and upon knowledge of the resources that are available to them. This allows the sensors to efficiently distribute data given a limited energy supply. We simulate and analyze the performance of four specific SPIN protocols: SPIN-PP and SPIN-EC, which are optimized for a point-to-point network, and SPIN-BC and SPIN-RL, which are optimized for a broadcast network. Comparing the SPIN protocols to other possible approaches, we find that the SPIN protocols can deliver 60{\%} more data for a given amount of energy than conventional approaches in a point-to-point network and 80{\%} more data for a given amount of energy in a broadcast network. We also find that, in terms of dissemination rate and energy usage, the SPIN protocols perform close to the theoretical optimum in both point-to-point and broadcast networks.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are playing more and more a key role in several application scenarios such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. Furthermore, WSNs are characterized by high heterogeneity because there are many different proprietary and non-proprietary solutions. This wide range of technologies has delayed new deployments and integration with existing sensor networks. The current trend, however, is to move away from proprietary and closed standards, to embrace IP-based sensor networks using the emerging standard 6LoWPAN/IPv6. This allows native connectivity between WSN and Internet, enabling smart objects to participate to the Internet of Things (IoT). Building an all-IP infrastructure from scratch, however, would be difficult because many different sensors and actuators technologies (both wired and wireless) have already been deployed over the years. After a review of the state of the art, this paper sketches a framework able to harmonize legacy and new installations, allowing migrating to an all-IP environment at a later stage. The Building Automation use case has been chosen to discuss potential benefits of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are rapidly gaining popularity in various critical domains like health care, critical infrastructure, and climate monitoring, where application builders have diversified development needs for programming, visualization, and simulation tools. However, these tools are designed as separate stand-alone applications. To avoid the complexity of using multiple tools, we have designed a new extensible, multi-platform, scalable, and open-source framework called PROVIZ. PROVIZ is an integrated visualization and programming framework with the following features: PROVIZ includes (1) a visualization tool that can visualize heterogeneous WSN traffic (with different packet payload formats) by parsing the data received either from a packet sniffer (e.g., a sensor-based sniffer or a commercial TI SmartRF 802.15.4 packet sniffer) or from a simulator (e.g., OMNeT); (2) a scripting language based on the TinyOS sensor network platform that aims at reducing code size and improving programming efficacy; (3) an over-the-air programming tool to securely program sensor nodes; (4) a visual programming tool with basic sensor drag-and-drop modules for generating simple WSN programs; and (5) a visual network comparison tool that analyzes packet traces of two networks to generate a juxtaposed visual comparison of contrasting network characteristics. PROVIZ also includes built-in extensible visual demo deployment capabilities that allow users to quickly craft network scenarios and share them with other users. In this work, we introduce the various features of PROVIZ's visualization and programming framework, analyze test scenarios, and discuss how all the tools can be used in sync with each other to create an all-encompassing development and test environment.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks have the potential to become significant subsystems of engineering applications. Before relegating important and safety-critical tasks to such subsystems, it is necessary to understand the dynamic behavior of these subsystems in simulation environments. There is an urgent need to develop simulation platforms that are useful to explore both the networking issues and the distributed computing aspects of wireless sensor networks. Current efforts to simulating wireless sensor networks largely focus on the networking issues. These approaches use well-known network simulation tools that are difficult to extend to explore distributed computing issues. Discrete-event simulation is a trusted platform for modeling and simulating a variety of systems. We report results obtained from a new simulator for wireless sensor networks networks that is based on the discrete event simulation framework called OMNeT++. Work is underway to develop a simulation platform that allows developers and researchers to investigate topological, phenomenological, networking, robustness and scaling issues related to wireless sensor networks. As a first step, we have developed simulations for the 802.11 MAC and the well-known sensor network protocol called Directed Diffusion. We demonstrate the performance of our simulator by comparing its performance to that of the well-known simulator ns2. Our results indicate that our simulator executes at least an order of magnitude faster than NS-2 and makes more efficient use of the available memory. The ease of modifying the sensor network and scalability, which is defined as the number of nodes that can be simulated, are two distinguishing features of our simulator.},

abstract = {Efficient water management is a major concern in many cropping systems in semiarid and arid areas. Distributed in-field sensor-based irrigation systemsoffer a potential solution to support site-specific irrigation management that allows producers to maximize their productivity while saving water. This paper describes details of the design and instrumentation of variable rate irrigation, a wireless sensor network, and software for real-time in-field sensing and control of a site-specific precision linear-move irrigation system. Field conditions were site-specifically monitored by six in-field sensor stations distributed across the field based on a soil property map, and periodically sampled and wirelessly transmitted to a base station. An irrigation machine was converted to be electronically controlled by a programming logic controller that updates georeferenced location of sprinklers from a differential Global Positioning System (GPS) and wirelessly communicates with a computer at the base station. Communication signals from the sensor network and irrigation controller to the base station were successfully interfaced using low-cost Bluetooth wireless radio communication. Graphic user interface-based software developed in this paper offered stable remote access to field conditions and real-time control and monitoring of the variable-rate irrigation controller.},

abstract = {With the recent technological advances in wireless commu- nications, integrated digital circuits, and micro electro me- chanical systems (MEMS); development of wireless sensor networks has been enabled and become dramatically feasible. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are large networks made of a numerous number of sensor nodes with sensing, com- putation, and wireless communications capabilities. Many various routing, power management, and data dissemina- tion protocols have been designed for wireless sensor net- works (WSNs) dependent on both the network architecture and the applications that it is designed for. In this paper, we present the state of the art of wireless sensor networks architecture and design features. Also, in this paper, we in- troduce recent work on routing protocols for WSNs and their design goals and challenges. Also, an overview of the ap- plication that WSNs assist in is presented. Finally, several open research questions of wireless sensor networks manage- ment and issues are suggested and put forward.},

Due to ever-increasing population growth, along with limited natural resources, smart cities are expected to be the wave of the future. For instance, WSNs are widely used in industrial settings with machine monitoring and play an important role in monitoring the structural integrity of large buildings and bridges.

abstract="Algorithms for scheduling TDMA transmissions in multi-hop networks usually determine the smallest length conflict-free assignment of slots in which each link or node is activated at least once. This is based on the assumption that there are many independent point-to-point flows in the network. In sensor networks however often data are transferred from the sensor nodes to a few central data collectors. The scheduling problem is therefore to determine the smallest length conflict-free assignment of slots during which the packets generated at each node reach their destination. The conflicting node transmissions are determined based on an interference graph, which may be different from connectivity graph due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions. We show that this problem is NP-complete. We first propose two centralized heuristic algorithms: one based on direct scheduling of the nodes or node-based scheduling, which is adapted from classical multi-hop scheduling algorithms for general ad hoc networks, and the other based on scheduling the levels in the routing tree before scheduling the nodes or level-based scheduling, which is a novel scheduling algorithm for many-to-one communication in sensor networks. The performance of these algorithms depends on the distribution of the nodes across the levels. We then propose a distributed algorithm based on the distributed coloring of the nodes, that increases the delay by a factor of 10--70 over centralized algorithms for 1000 nodes. We also obtain upper bound for these schedules as a function of the total number of packets generated in the network.",

ABSTRACT = {Sensors are increasingly used in mobile environments with wireless network connections. Multiple sensor types measure distinct aspects of the same event. Their measurements are then combined to produce integrated, reliable results. As the number of sensors in networks increases, low energy requirements and changing network connections complicate event detection and measurement. We present a data fusion scheme for use in mobile wireless sensor networks with high energy efficiency and low network delays, that still produces reliable results. In the first phase, we used a network simulation where mobile agents dynamically select the next hop migration node based on the stability parameter of the link, and perform the data fusion at the migration node. Agents use the fusion results to decide if it should return the fusion results to the processing center or continue to collect more data. In the second phase. The feasibility of data fusion at the node level is confirmed by an experimental design where fused data from color sensors show near-identical results to actual physical temperatures. These results are potentially important for new large-scale sensor network applications.},

abstract = "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become a leading solution in many important applications such as intrusion detection, target tracking, industrial automation, smart building and so on. The sensor nodes are generally unattended after their deployment in hazardous, hostile or remote areas. These nodes have to work with their limited and non replenish able energy resources. Energy efficiency is one of the main design objectives for these sensor networks. Medium Access Control MAC sub-layer is part of Data Link layer in WSN's protocol stack. The energy consumption of sensor nodes is greatly affected by MAC protocol which controls the node radio functionalities. In this paper, the design requirements of energy efficient MAC protocols for WSNs are reviewed and classified. Several MAC protocols for the WSNs are described emphasizing their strength and weakness. Also, the paper introduces cross-layer protocols as a concept that leads to benefit from the network resources as well as prolonging network lifetime. The paper is appended by comparison between existing protocols regarding protocol's type, cross-layer support, and MAC scheduling. Finally, future research directions in the MAC protocol design are proposed."

abstract="Transport layer protocols in WSNs should support multiple applications, variable reliability, packet-loss recovery, and congestionCongestioncontrolCongestion control. A transport layer protocol should be generic and independent of the application. Transport protocols are quite abundant, with varying design goals to match their intended use. Depending on their functions, WSN applications can tolerate different levels of packet loss. Packet lossPacket lossmay be due to bad radio communication, congestionCongestion, packet collision, full memory capacity, and node failurePacket lossnode failures. Packet loss can result in wasted energy and degraded quality of service (QoSPerformance metricsQoS Quality of Service Performance metrics of WSNsquality of service) in data delivery. Detection of packet loss and correctly recovering missing packets can improve throughput and energy expenditure. There are two approaches for packet recovery: hop-by-hopCongestion controlhop-by-hop Hop-by-hopand end-to-endCongestion controlend-to-end End-to-end. Hop-by-hop retransmission requires that an intermediate node cache the packet information in its memory. This method is more energy efficient since retransmission distance is shorter. For end-to-end retransmission, the source caches all the packet information and performs retransmission when there is a packet loss. End-to-end retransmission allows for variable reliabilityPerformance metricsreliability Reliability Performance metrics of WSNsreliabilitywhereas hop-by-hop retransmission performs better when reliability requirements are high. A congestion control mechanism monitors and detects congestion, thereby preserving energy. Before congestion occurs, the source is notified to reduce its sending rate. CongestionCongestioncontrolCongestion controlhelps reduce retransmission and prevents sensor buffer overrun. As in packet-loss recovery, there are two approaches to congestion control: hop-by-hopCongestion controlhop-by-hop Hop-by-hopand end-to-endCongestion controlend-to-end End-to-end. Hop-by-hop mechanism requires every node along the path to monitor buffer overflows. Hop-by-hop mechanism lessens congestion at a faster rate than the end-to-end mechanism. When a sensor node detects congestion, all nodes along the path change their behavior. End-to-end mechanism relies on the end nodes to detect congestion. Congestion is flagged when timeout or redundant acknowledgements are received. There are tradeoffs between hop-by-hop and end-to-end approaches for packet-loss recovery and congestion control mechanism. Depending on the type, reliability.Performance metricsreliability Reliability Performance metrics of WSNsreliability, and time sensitivity of the application, one approach may be better than the other.
